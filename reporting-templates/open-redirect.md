# Open Redirect

**Description:**  Open redirect vulnerabilities occur when attackers manipulate certain parameters in a URL to trick a web application into redirecting users to a different, often malicious, website. This manipulation can occur through user-supplied input or by exploiting flaws in the application's logic.

The impact of open redirect vulnerabilities can be significant. Attackers can exploit them to craft convincing phishing attacks, where users are directed to fake login pages or other deceptive websites designed to steal their credentials or sensitive information. Moreover, open redirects can be used as part of larger attack chains, where they serve as a stepping stone for further exploitation. For example, an attacker might use an open redirect to disguise the malicious URL of a drive-by download or to redirect users to a website hosting malware.

**Solution:** To mitigate open redirect vulnerabilities, developers should implement several key strategies:

1. **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, including URL parameters, to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious payloads. This can involve using server-side validation techniques such as input validation libraries or regular expressions.
2. **Whitelisting:** Implement whitelisting mechanisms to restrict the destinations to which the application can redirect users. Whitelists should include only trusted URLs or URL patterns, preventing attackers from redirecting users to arbitrary or malicious websites.
